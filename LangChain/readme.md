# 1. Daily Motivation Bot

This simple Python app uses the Google Gemini API to generate motivational messages based on the user's mood. The app prompts the user to enter their mood (e.g., "happy", "stressed", "unmotivated"), and then it sends a request to the Gemini API, which responds with a customized motivational message.


***Change Your API Key***: Before running the app, don't forget to replace your_gemini_api_key with your actual Gemini API key in the script.
